    "The issue seems to be that R is not found in your current PATH, which is necessary for running R from the terminal. This might be because R is not installed in the virtual environment or the path to the system-wide R installation is not included in your PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to resolve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Ensure R is Installed and Accessible\n",
    "1. **Check if R is installed system-wide**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    which R\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This should return the path to the R executable, such as `/usr/local/bin/R`. If it doesnâ€™t, you may need to install R.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install R** (if not already installed):\n",
    "    - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Add R to the PATH\n",
    "1. **Find the path to the R executable**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    which R\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Assume it returns `/usr/local/bin/R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add the R path to your PATH environment variable**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add the R path to your shell configuration file** (`~/.zshrc` if you are using zsh):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reload the shell configuration file**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Register the IRKernel Again\n",
    "1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    source /Users/apollo/documents/athena/myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensure Jupyter is installed**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install jupyter jupyter-client\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open R from the terminal**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    R\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the IRKernel installation command**:\n",
    "    ```R\n",
    "    IRkernel::installspec(user = TRUE)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Kernel Registration\n",
    "1. **Check available Jupyter kernels**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps should ensure that R is accessible from the terminal and allow you to properly register the IRKernel for use in Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode."
